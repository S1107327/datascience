            I can help you decide where to go eat! You can ask me multiple things.
            You can ask me info about restaurants in the NY area. Specifically, you can ask me:
              -The list of all the restaurants in the area.
              -All of the possibile cuisine types you can choose from.
              -Which restaurants offer a specific type of cuisine.
              -Info about a restaurant you're curious of.
            You can then ask me to reserve a place in a restaurant of you choice! For that I will need some information:
              -In which place you want to go, of course.
              -How many people you want to reserve for.
              -The date of the reservation.
              -At what time you would like to go eat.
              -Whether you suffer from some allergies.
              -Your name.
              -Your phone number.
            Once you've made one or more reservations, you can also ask me to remind you of them.
            I hope that I was clear enough!
